##Installation Instructions
**Sorry friends not using a Mac, these instructions require Xcode**
- Make sure npm is installed on your machine, if not head on over to <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">nodejs.org</a> and take care of that
- Clone `git clone http://github/YOURREPOINFO` the repository or copy it on to your machine
- Change the current directory in the commandline to reactNative `cd reactNative`
- Once inside the reactNative directory, install the required node modules by typing `npm install`

- Make sure you have Xcode installed, if not you can do this at the App store
- Open Xcode and then open the project by selecting "Open another project..." (specifically, you will need to have Xcode open your `reactNative.xcodeproj` file in your reactNative directory)
- Once Xcode opens and indexes the files, press cmd-R or the run button to have Xcode build your app
